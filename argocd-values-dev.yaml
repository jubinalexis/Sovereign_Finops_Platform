# ArgoCD Configuration - Development Environment
# ⚠️ WARNING: This configuration is INSECURE and only suitable for LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
# DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION - See argocd-values-prod.yaml for production config

server:
  # ❌ INSECURE: Disable TLS for local development
  # Production MUST use TLS with valid certificates
  insecure: true
  
  # ❌ HIGHLY INSECURE: Anonymous admin access enabled
  # This allows ANYONE to access ArgoCD with full admin privileges
  # No password required - purely for demo purposes
  rbacConfig:
    policy.default: role:admin
  
  # Additional UI configuration
  config:
    # Allow anonymous users to view applications
    users.anonymous.enabled: "true"

# Controller configuration
controller:
  # Metrics for Prometheus
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    serviceMonitor:
      enabled: false  # Enable if Prometheus Operator is installed

# Development-friendly settings
configs:
  params:
    # Faster sync for development
    timeout.reconciliation: 60s  # Check for changes every 60s (default: 180s)
    
  repositories:
    # If you need to add private repos in dev
    # DO NOT commit actual credentials here - use external secret management

# Resource limits for development (lower than production)
# Adjust based on your local machine resources

  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 512Mi
    requests:

      memory: 128Mi

# ⚠️ SECURITY SUMMARY FOR DEV ENVIRONMENT:
# - No TLS encryption
# - Anonymous admin access
# - No RBAC enforcement
# - No SSO integration
# - Faster sync intervals (more resource usage)
#
# This configuration trades security for convenience in LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY
